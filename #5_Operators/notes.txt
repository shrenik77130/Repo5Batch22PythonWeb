Operators


    -> Operators are mathamatical symbols used to evaluate and perform complex operations
    
    Arithmetic Operators        : + - * / // %
    Assignment Operators        : = += -= /= //= %=
    Relational Operators        : > < >= <= == !=
    Logical Operators           : and or not
    Bitwise Operators           : >> <<
    Other                       : is in
    
    
    Forms of Operators  
    ------------------
    1. Unary Operators
            Operators which operate on only one operand is called as "Unary Opearators"
            e.g.  ++ -- (not in python)
            
    2. Binary Operators
            Operators which operate on two operand is called as "Binary Opearators"
            e.g. + - * / += -= etc.
            
    Operators Priority to solve equetion
    ------------------------------------
    ()  / // % * += -=
